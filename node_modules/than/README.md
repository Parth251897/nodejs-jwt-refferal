# Than

Make your functions asynchronous by using the `than` function !!!

## Installation

Use the npm command

    npm install than

## Usage

This package adds a prototype to `Function`, to use it, you need first to require it :

    require('than');

## Example

Here is an example showing you how this `than` function can be used

Let's say you have a function with blocking code

    function calculate(a, b) {
        /*
            Your code that might take too long to execute !
         */

        return a + b;
    }

So, instead of calling the function directly by passing two arguments, you can pass these arguments to the `than` function and a callBack that receives the result of the main function.

    console.log("Do something");

    calculate.than(1, 2, function(result) {
        console.log("Then display the result : ", result);
    });

    console.log("Do other thing");

If the `calculate` function takes too long to finish its execution, the output of the code above would be :

    Do something
    Do other thing
    Then display the result : 3
